# Network Scanner Tool – Project Report

## Objective
To develop a Python-based tool that scans a network to identify active hosts
and commonly used open ports.

## Introduction
Network scanning is a foundational step in cybersecurity assessments. It helps
identify reachable devices and exposed services.

## Methodology
- Ping-based host discovery
- TCP socket-based port scanning
- Multithreading for faster execution

## Advantages
- Simple and efficient
- Easy to extend
- Practical learning tool

## Limitations
- ICMP may be blocked
- Limited port range

## Future Enhancements
- Full port range scanning
- UDP scanning
- OS detection
- Export results to file

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical network reconnaissance techniques using Python.
